"""Rewrite a candidate with QC's notes, sent back to the model that wrote it.

Two triggers, one mechanism:

- waitlist: a shortlisted candidate comes back in the *next* round. run_round.py pulls
  every one still in the pool and calls this for each.
- revise: a candidate selected with notes is rewritten *immediately*. The review site
  calls this in the background the moment QC submits, and the rewrite lands in the same
  round for QC to approve.

The rewrite goes to the same model on purpose. What a rewrite tests is whether this author
can fix what QC pointed at; handing it to another model would make it a new candidate
wearing an old id.

Rewrites stay out of per-model baseline statistics (store.stats). That comparison rests on
every model on a slot receiving an identical brief, and a rewrite brief is by construction
unique to one story.

    python tools/story_pipeline/rewrite.py c-a7f3                 # revise now, same round
    python tools/story_pipeline/rewrite.py c-a7f3 --dry-run       # stub model
